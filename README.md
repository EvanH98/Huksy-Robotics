# 2017-18
Code base for the 2017-18 build season

## Scarlet
Scarlet is a C# robotics library, originally designed for the Science station. It is meant to be modular, flexible, cross-platform, and usable by all subsystems. Developed by @CaiB and @baldstrom, we invite you to have a look and use it. *Please* read the documentation in [our OneNote notebook](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AseFMLuUHe5LlrNT8SEuX9cTHDTddA) \(No signin required\)

## Git Procedure
Make a new feature branch off of the main development branch. Implement a feature in the branch and then generate a pull request to the master branch which will be reviewed by another software team member before being approved. You are not allowed to push your code directly to the master branch.
