# Science

Location of the science subsystem code and electronics projects. Please see documentation in [our OneNote notebook](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AseFMLuUHe5LlrNT8SEuX9cTHDTddA).

After last year's events, science software will be written in C#, no more Python. If contributing, please read the documentation in [our OneNote notebook](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AseFMLuUHe5LlrNT8SEuX9cTHDTddA) for style and structure guidelines.

We use [Visual Studio 2017 Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) for development, and recommend you do the same to make getting started easier, as we have projects and build procedures already set up. Our documentation has information about running C# programs on the Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone.

# Scarlet
Interested in Scarlet, our modular, flexible, and system-agnostic library? **Please read the documentation found in [our OneNote notebook](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AseFMLuUHe5LlrNT8SEuX9cTHDTddA)!** I promise it's worth it. There, you can find an overview, getting started guide, as well as some architecture & functionality descriptions.
